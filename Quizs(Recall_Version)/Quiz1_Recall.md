**(a)For differential equation y(k+1)+2y(k)=1(k), y(k)=0 for k<0. Find the discrete function y(k). The 1(k) refers to unit step function. In addition, try to configure if Final Value Thereom could be used in this equation to get the final value y($\infty$) through y($\infty$)=$lim_{z \to 1} Y(z)$**
